# Covid19ManagementSystem

I have made 3 core modules that are add new users, edit and delete.

By using jstl core libraries, html, java servlets I created these modules. 
There are 3 packages for database management, model and the core part that is the web 
part where servelt class has been implemented. There are core methods which are defined to 
serve the purposes for insert data, update data, delete data, edit data, how ever edit data and 
update data is not different at all. The two jsp files user-list.jsp displays all the hospitalised 
patients with the necessary details with covid status as one of them. And the other jsp file named "user-form" 
is responsible for displaying the form for add new user and edit existing user with the update modules connected with it. 
This is a basic web application to keep record of hospitalised patients and update the details of patients incase necessary.
